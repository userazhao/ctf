## Description

You have infiltrated the internal forum of a bioscience corporation. Retrieve the flag by decoding the recently analyzed specimen.

## Challenge

Ever since I first learned about DNA codons, I've thought that a clever use for them would be creating hidden messages out of DNA. The main focus of this challenge is to decode such a message, and to that aim the challenge includes some educational content to help people unfamiliar with DNA get up to speed. Additionally, solvers are also asked to do a little bit of steganography and have a basic grasp of cryptography.
